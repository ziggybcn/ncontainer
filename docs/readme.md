## Welcome to NContainer!

This dependency injection container does not have any specific pre-requisite other than download and use. It has no external dependencies and it's meant to be small, easy to modify, light to use and easy to understand.

If you want to learn how to use it, just go ahead to the Tests folder and all tests should be self explanatory.
